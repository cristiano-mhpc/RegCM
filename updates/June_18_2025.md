## MEETING TODAY 

1. Run the entire RegCM code as it is now on Leonardo and obtain benchmarking data for the following cases:
    - Full CPU instance of the code with only MPI. Obtain a scaling (if there is) for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 cores.  
    - The version of the code with GPU offloading. Obtain scaling for (1 core 1 gpu), (2 cores 2 GPUs), (4 cores 4 GPUS), then (8 cores, 8 GPUs)
    - The hybrid version of the code with both MPI and OpenMP without GPU. Obtain scaling as well. 

  **NOTE**: 

  - For now we set the problem size fixed so we are expecting to see some strong scaling. 

  - Our first priority is to benchmarch runtimes. It would also be nice if I can learn to profile the code. 

  - Make sure to run consistently on the same node ID to make the runs homogeneous.

Later on ...

2. Test other platforms other GPUs AMD GPUs
